# CMYKinator

CMYKinator is an image processing program that converts RGB digital art to printable CMYK art. To limit color distortion during the conversion, the program allows the artist to adjust the individual CMYK channels to fine tune the color channels. 

The program also allows the artist to resize the image to match paper sizes as well as add their watermark to the artwork. Adjustments to transparency and placement of the watermark are available as well.
