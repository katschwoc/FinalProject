# CMYKinator

CMYKinator is an image processing program that converts RGB digital art to printable CMYK art. To limit color distortion during the conversion, the program allows the artist to adjust the individual CMYK channels to fine tune the color channels. 

The program also allows the artist to resize the image to match paper sizes as well as add their watermark to the artwork. Adjustments to transparency and placement of the watermark are available as well.

## Future Improvements

Researching how to adjust ICC profiles such as Coated and Uncoated revealed that it is possible to add this feature in future versions. However, it is beyond my capacity to impliment it effectively at the moment. I would need to download specific ICC profiles or use the preinstalled versions on my computer. However, as far as I understand, the feature would not on Mac and Linux if I used the windows ICC version on my computer. 

## Scrapped Ideas

Originally, I intended to include a contrast adjustment option. This feature turned the image grey so it was scrapped. 
Additionally, I intended to include batch rendering. After thinking through this idea, I realized this wouldn't be an ideal option for digital artists because art work sizes and orientation might vary, placement of watermarks might need to be different on each image, and the cmyk channel adjustments would not be the same for every artwork.
